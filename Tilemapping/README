Maybe this will be merged to a lib once finished.

Done:
Supporting 2d tileset
-can handle different height width for the tiles and different espacement values

-* TODO *-
High priority : 
LEVEL EDITOR
-This is the next thing that i'm going to do
PROPERTIES
-Each tile has different properties
-Coming with the level editor, wich will be able to modify these.

Then:
Scrolling handling and a lot of *not so* exciting features.
